# CountCraft Backlog

## Near-Term Features
- Math fact analysis: show correct/incorrect counts and accuracy per fact.
- Harder distractors: add digit swaps and other algorithms for tougher multiple choice options.
- Practice recommendations: suggest a subset of the grid to focus on next.
- Explanation navigation: diagonal arrows and top-center arrows to jump between operations.
- Feedback cues: clearer correct/incorrect response (visual + haptic/audio).
- Probability: add hypergeometric (without replacement) for cards.
- Probability: toggle between "at least" and "exactly" counts.
